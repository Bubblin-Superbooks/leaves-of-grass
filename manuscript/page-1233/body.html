<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>As one by one withdraw the lofty actors, From that great play on history's stage eterne, That lurid, partial act of war and peace&mdash;of old and new contending, Fought out through wrath, fears, dark dismays, and many a long suspense; All past&mdash;and since, in countless graves receding, mellowing, Victor's and vanquish'd&mdash;Lincoln's and Lee's&mdash;now thou with them, Man of the mighty days&mdash;and equal to the days! Thou from the prairies!&mdash;tangled and many-vein'd and hard has been thy part, To admiration has it been enacted!</p></div> </div>
