<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> To me every hour of the light and dark is a miracle, Every cubic inch of space is a miracle, Every square yard of the surface of the earth is spread with the same, Every foot of the interior swarms with the same. To me the sea is a continual miracle, The fishes that swim&mdash;the rocks&mdash;the motion of the waves&mdash;the ships with men in them, What stranger miracles are there?</p></div> </div>
