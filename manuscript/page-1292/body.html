<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Not meagre, latent boughs alone, O songs! (scaly and bare, like eagles' talons,) But haply for some sunny day (who knows?) some future spring, some summer&mdash;bursting forth, To verdant leaves, or sheltering shade&mdash;to nourishing fruit, Apples and grapes&mdash;the stalwart limbs of trees emerging&mdash;the fresh, free, open air, And love and faith, like scented roses blooming.</p></div> </div>
