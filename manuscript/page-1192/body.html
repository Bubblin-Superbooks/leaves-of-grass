<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A carol closing sixty-nine&mdash;a resume&mdash;a repetition, My lines in joy and hope continuing on the same, Of ye, O God, Life, Nature, Freedom, Poetry; Of you, my Land&mdash;your rivers, prairies, States&mdash;you, mottled Flag I love, Your aggregate retain'd entire&mdash;Of north, south, east and west, your items all; Of me myself&mdash;the jocund heart yet beating in my breast, The body wreck'd, old, poor and paralyzed&mdash;the strange inertia falling pall-like round me, The burning fires down in my sluggish blood not yet extinct, The undiminish'd faith&mdash;the groups of loving friends.</p></div> </div>
