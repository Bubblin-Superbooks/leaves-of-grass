<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>At the last, tenderly, From the walls of the powerful fortress'd house, From the clasp of the knitted locks, from the keep of the well-closed doors, Let me be wafted. Let me glide noiselessly forth; With the key of softness unlock the locks&mdash;with a whisper, Set ope the doors O soul. Tenderly&mdash;be not impatient, (Strong is your hold O mortal flesh, Strong is your hold O love.)</p></div> </div>
