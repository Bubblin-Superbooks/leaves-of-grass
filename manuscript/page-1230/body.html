<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>With husky-haughty lips, O sea! Where day and night I wend thy surf-beat shore, Imaging to my sense thy varied strange suggestions, (I see and plainly list thy talk and conference here,) Thy troops of white-maned racers racing to the goal, Thy ample, smiling face, dash'd with the sparkling dimples of the sun, Thy brooding scowl and murk&mdash;thy unloos'd hurricanes, Thy unsubduedness, caprices, wilfulness; Great as thou art above the rest, thy many tears&mdash;a lack from all eternity in thy content, (Naught but the greatest struggles, wrongs, defeats, could make thee greatest&mdash;no less could make thee,) Thy lonely state&mdash;something thou ever seek'st and seek'st, yet never gain'st, Surely some right withheld&mdash;</p></div> </div>
