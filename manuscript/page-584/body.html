<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But there is one thing that belongs here&mdash;shall I tell you what it is, gentlemen of Boston? I will whisper it to the Mayor, he shall send a committee to England, They shall get a grant from the Parliament, go with a cart to the royal vault, Dig out King George's coffin, unwrap him quick from the graveclothes, box up his bones for a journey, Find a swift Yankee clipper&mdash;here is freight for you, black-bellied clipper, Up with your anchor&mdash;shake out your sails&mdash;steer straight toward Boston bay. Now call for the President's marshal again, bring out the government cannon, Fetch home the roarers from Congress, make another procession, guard it with foot and dragoons. This centre-piece for them; Look, all orderly citizens&mdash;</p></div> </div>
