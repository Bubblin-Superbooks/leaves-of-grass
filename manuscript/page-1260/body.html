<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Old farmers, travelers, workmen (no matter how crippled or bent,) Old sailors, out of many a perilous voyage, storm and wreck, Old soldiers from campaigns, with all their wounds, defeats and scars; Enough that they've survived at all&mdash;long life's unflinching ones! Forth from their struggles, trials, fights, to have emerged at all&mdash; in that alone, True conquerors o'er all the rest.</p></div> </div>
