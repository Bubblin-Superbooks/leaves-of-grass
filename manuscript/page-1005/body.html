<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> 3 To think the thought of death merged in the thought of materials, To think of all these wonders of city and country, and others taking great interest in them, and we taking no interest in them. To think how eager we are in building our houses, To think others shall be just as eager, and we quite indifferent. (I see one building the house that serves him a few years, or seventy or eighty years at most, I see one building the house that serves him longer than that.) Slow-moving and black lines creep over the whole earth&mdash;they never cease&mdash;they are the burial lines, He that was President was buried, and he that is now President shall surely be buried.</p><p>4 A reminiscence of the vulgar fate, A frequent sample of the life and death of workmen, Each after his kind.</p></div> </div>
