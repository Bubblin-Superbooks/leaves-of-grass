<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Hush'd be the camps to-day, And soldiers let us drape our war-worn weapons, And each with musing soul retire to celebrate, Our dear commander's death. No more for him life's stormy conflicts, Nor victory, nor defeat&mdash;no more time's dark events, Charging like ceaseless clouds across the sky. But sing poet in our name, Sing of the love we bore him&mdash;because you, dweller in camps, know it truly. As they invault the coffin there, Sing&mdash;as they close the doors of earth upon him&mdash;one verse, For the heavy hearts of soldiers.</p></div> </div>
