<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>For his o'erarching and last lesson the greybeard sufi, In the fresh scent of the morning in the open air, On the slope of a teeming Persian rose-garden, Under an ancient chestnut-tree wide spreading its branches, Spoke to the young priests and students. "Finally my children, to envelop each word, each part of the rest, Allah is all, all, all&mdash;immanent in every life and object, May-be at many and many-a-more removes&mdash;yet Allah, Allah, Allah is there. "Has the estray wander'd far? Is the reason-why strangely hidden? Would you sound below the restless ocean of the entire world? Would you know the dissatisfaction? the urge and spur of every life; The something never still'd&mdash;never entirely gone? the invisible need of every seed?</p></div> </div>
