<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> For not life's joys alone I sing, repeating&mdash;the joy of death! The beautiful touch of Death, soothing and benumbing a few moments, for reasons, Myself discharging my excrementitious body to be burn'd, or render'd to powder, or buried, My real body doubtless left to me for other spheres, My voided body nothing more to me, returning to the purifications, further offices, eternal uses of the earth. O to attract by more than attraction! How it is I know not&mdash;yet behold! the something which obeys none of the rest, It is offensive, never defensive&mdash;yet how magnetic it draws. O to struggle against great odds, to meet enemies undaunted! To be entirely alone with them, to find how much one can stand! To look strife, torture, prison, popular odium, face to face! To mount the scaffold, to advance to the muzzles of guns with perfect nonchalance! To be indeed a God! O to sail to sea in a ship!</p></div> </div>
