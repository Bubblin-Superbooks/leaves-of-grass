<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Ah, whispering, something again, unseen, Where late this heated day thou enterest at my window, door, Thou, laving, tempering all, cool-freshing, gently vitalizing Me, old, alone, sick, weak-down, melted-worn with sweat; Thou, nestling, folding close and firm yet soft, companion better than talk, book, art, (Thou hast, O Nature! elements! utterance to my heart beyond the rest&mdash;and this is of them,) So sweet thy primitive taste to breathe within&mdash;thy soothing fingers my face and hands, Thou, messenger&mdash;magical strange bringer to body and spirit of me, (Distances balk'd&mdash;occult medicines penetrating me from head to foot,) I feel the sky, the prairies vast&mdash;I feel the mighty northern lakes, I feel the ocean and the forest&mdash;somehow I feel the globe itself swift-swimming in space; Thou blown from lips so loved, now gone&mdash;</p></div> </div>
