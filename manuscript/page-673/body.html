<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> from deeps more unfathomable, something more deadly and savage, Manhattan rising, advancing with menacing front&mdash;Cincinnati, Chicago, unchain'd; What was that swell I saw on the ocean? behold what comes here, How it climbs with daring feet and hands&mdash;how it dashes! How the true thunder bellows after the lightning&mdash;how bright the flashes of lightning! How Democracy with desperate vengeful port strides on, shown through the dark by those flashes of lightning! (Yet a mournful wall and low sob I fancied I heard through the dark, In a lull of the deafening confusion.) 3 Thunder on! stride on, Democracy! strike with vengeful stroke! And do you rise higher than ever yet O days, O cities! Crash heavier, heavier yet O storms!</p></div> </div>
