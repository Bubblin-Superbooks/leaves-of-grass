I stand again in leaden rain your flapping folds saluting, I sing you over all, flying beckoning through the fight&mdash;O the hard-contested fight! The cannons ope their rosy-flashing muzzles&mdash;the hurtled balls scream, The battle-front forms amid the smoke&mdash;the volleys pour incessant from the line, Hark, the ringing word Charge!&mdash;now the tussle and the furious maddening yells, Now the corpses tumble curl'd upon the ground, Cold, cold in death, for precious life of you, Angry cloth I saw there leaping.) 12 Are you he who would assume a place to teach or be a poet here in the States?
