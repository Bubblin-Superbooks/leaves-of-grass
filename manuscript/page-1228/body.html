<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>(a swordless conflict, Yet more than all Rome's wars of old, or modern Napoleon's:) the peaceful choice of all, Or good or ill humanity&mdash;welcoming the darker odds, the dross: &mdash;Foams and ferments the wine? it serves to purify&mdash;while the heart pants, life glows: These stormy gusts and winds waft precious ships, Swell'd Washington's, Jefferson's, Lincoln's sails.</p></div> </div>
