<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>To those who've fail'd, in aspiration vast, To unnam'd soldiers fallen in front on the lead, To calm, devoted engineers&mdash;to over-ardent travelers&mdash;to pilots on their ships, To many a lofty song and picture without recognition&mdash;I'd rear laurel-cover'd monument, High, high above the rest&mdash;To all cut off before their time, Possess'd by some strange spirit of fire, Quench'd by an early death.</p></div> </div>
