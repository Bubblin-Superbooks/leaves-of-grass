<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Spirit of hours I knew, all hectic red one day, but pale as death next day, Touch my mouth ere you depart, press my lips close, Leave me your pulses of rage&mdash;bequeath them to me&mdash;fill me with currents convulsive, Let them scorch and blister out of my chants when you are gone, Let them identify you to the future in these songs.</p></div> </div>
