<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Child: O father it is alive&mdash;it is full of people&mdash;it has children, O now it seems to me it is talking to its children, I hear it&mdash;it talks to me&mdash;O it is wonderful! O it stretches&mdash;it spreads and runs so fast&mdash;O my father, It is so broad it covers the whole sky. Father: Cease, cease, my foolish babe, What you are saying is sorrowful to me, much 't displeases me; Behold with the rest again I say, behold not banners and pennants aloft, But the well-prepared pavements behold, and mark the solid-wall'd houses. Banner and Pennant: Speak to the child O bard out of Manhattan, To our children all, or north or south of Manhattan, Point this day, leaving all the rest, to us over all&mdash;</p></div> </div>
