<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Appearances, now or henceforth, indicate what you are, You necessary film, continue to envelop the soul, About my body for me, and your body for you, be hung our divinest aromas, Thrive, cities&mdash;bring your freight, bring your shows, ample and sufficient rivers, Expand, being than which none else is perhaps more spiritual, Keep your places, objects than which none else is more lasting. You have waited, you always wait, you dumb, beautiful ministers, We receive you with free sense at last, and are insatiate henceforward, Not you any more shall be able to foil us, or withhold yourselves from us, We use you, and do not cast you aside&mdash;we plant you permanently within us, We fathom you not&mdash;we love you&mdash;there is perfection in you also, You furnish your parts toward eternity, Great or small, you furnish your parts toward the soul.</p></div> </div>
