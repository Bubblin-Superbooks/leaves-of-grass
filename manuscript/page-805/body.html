<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>one does not countervail another any more than one eyesight countervails another, or one life countervails another. All is eligible to all, All is for individuals, all is for you, No condition is prohibited, not God's or any. All comes by the body, only health puts you rapport with the universe. Produce great Persons, the rest follows. 4 Piety and conformity to them that like, Peace, obesity, allegiance, to them that like, I am he who tauntingly compels men, women, nations, Crying, Leap from your seats and contend for your lives! I am he who walks the States with a barb'd tongue, questioning every one I meet, Who are you that wanted only to be told what you knew before? Who are you that wanted only a book to join you in your nonsense? (With pangs and cries as thine own O bearer of many children, These clamors wild to a race of pride I give.)</p></div> </div>
