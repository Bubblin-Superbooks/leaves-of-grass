<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> By thee fact to be justified, blended with thought, Thought of man justified, blended with God, Through thy idea, lo, the immortal reality! Through thy reality, lo, the immortal idea! 3 Brain of the New World, what a task is thine, To formulate the Modern&mdash;out of the peerless grandeur of the modern, Out of thyself, comprising science, to recast poems, churches, art, (Recast, may-be discard them, end them&mdash;maybe their work is done, who knows?) By vision, hand, conception, on the background of the mighty past, the dead, To limn with absolute faith the mighty living present. And yet thou living present brain, heir of the dead, the Old World brain, Thou that lay folded like an unborn babe within its folds so long, Thou carefully prepared by it so long&mdash;haply thou but unfoldest it, only maturest it, It to eventuate in thee&mdash;</p></div> </div>
