<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>On, on the same, ye jocund twain! My life and recitative, containing birth, youth, mid-age years, Fitful as motley-tongues of flame, inseparably twined and merged in one&mdash;combining all, My single soul&mdash;aims, confirmations, failures, joys&mdash;Nor single soul alone, I chant my nation's crucial stage, (America's, haply humanity's)&mdash; the trial great, the victory great, A strange eclaircissement of all the masses past, the eastern world, the ancient, medieval, Here, here from wanderings, strayings, lessons, wars, defeats&mdash;here at the west a voice triumphant&mdash;justifying all, A gladsome pealing cry&mdash;a song for once of utmost pride and satisfaction; I chant from it the common bulk, the general average horde, (the best sooner than the worst)&mdash;And now I chant old age, (My verses, written first for forenoon life, and for the summer's, autumn's spread, I pass to snow-white hairs the same, and give to pulses winter-cool'd the same;)</p></div> </div>
