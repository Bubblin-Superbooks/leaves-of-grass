<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In large calm halls, a stately museum shall teach you the infinite lessons of minerals, In another, woods, plants, vegetation shall be illustrated&mdash;in another animals, animal life and development. One stately house shall be the music house, Others for other arts&mdash;learning, the sciences, shall all be here, None shall be slighted, none but shall here be honor'd, help'd, exampled. 6 (This, this and these, America, shall be your pyramids and obelisks, Your Alexandrian Pharos, gardens of Babylon, Your temple at Olympia.) The male and female many laboring not, Shall ever here confront the laboring many, With precious benefits to both, glory to all, To thee America, and thee eternal Muse. And here shall ye inhabit powerful Matrons! In your vast state vaster than all the old, Echoed through long, long centuries to come, To sound of different, prouder songs, with stronger themes, Practical, peaceful life, the people's life, the People themselves, Lifted, illumin'd, bathed in peace&mdash;elate, secure in peace.</p></div> </div>
