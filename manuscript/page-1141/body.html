<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But aside from these and the marts of wealth and the crowded promenade, Admitting around me comrades close unseen by the rest and voiceless, The slain elate and alive again, the dust and debris alive, I chant this chant of my silent soul in the name of all dead soldiers. Faces so pale with wondrous eyes, very dear, gather closer yet, Draw close, but speak not. Phantoms of countless lost, Invisible to the rest henceforth become my companions, Follow me ever&mdash;desert me not while I live. Sweet are the blooming cheeks of the living&mdash;sweet are the musical voices sounding, But sweet, ah sweet, are the dead with their silent eyes. Dearest comrades, all is over and long gone, But love is not over&mdash;and what love, O comrades! Perfume from battle-fields rising, up from the foetor arising.</p></div> </div>
