<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>How dare one say it? After the cycles, poems, singers, plays, Vaunted Ionia's, India's&mdash;Homer, Shakspere&mdash;the long, long times' thick dotted roads, areas, The shining clusters and the Milky Ways of stars&mdash;Nature's pulses reap'd, All retrospective passions, heroes, war, love, adoration, All ages' plummets dropt to their utmost depths, All human lives, throats, wishes, brains&mdash;all experiences' utterance; After the countless songs, or long or short, all tongues, all lands, Still something not yet told in poesy's voice or print&mdash;something lacking, (Who knows? the best yet unexpress'd and lacking.)</p></div> </div>
