<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>silent woods, or even amid the sights of war, Wherever I have been I have charged myself with contentment and triumph. I sing to the last the equalities modern or old, I sing the endless finales of things, I say Nature continues, glory continues, I praise with electric voice, For I do not see one imperfection in the universe, And I do not see one cause or result lamentable at last in the universe. O setting sun! though the time has come, I still warble under you, if none else does, unmitigated adoration.</p></div> </div>
