<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Ever the undiscouraged, resolute, struggling soul of man; (Have former armies fail'd? then we send fresh armies&mdash;and fresh again;) Ever the grappled mystery of all earth's ages old or new; Ever the eager eyes, hurrahs, the welcome-clapping hands, the loud applause; Ever the soul dissatisfied, curious, unconvinced at last; Struggling to-day the same&mdash;battling the same.</p></div> </div>
