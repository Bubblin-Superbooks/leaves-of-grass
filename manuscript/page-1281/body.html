<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Shot gold, maroon and violet, dazzling silver, emerald, fawn, The earth's whole amplitude and Nature's multiform power consign'd for once to colors; The light, the general air possess'd by them&mdash;colors till now unknown, No limit, confine&mdash;not the Western sky alone&mdash;the high meridian&mdash; North, South, all, Pure luminous color fighting the silent shadows to the last.</p></div> </div>
