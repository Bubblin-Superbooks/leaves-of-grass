<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A Boston Ballad [1854]</p><p>To get betimes in Boston town I rose this morning early, Here's a good place at the corner, I must stand and see the show. Clear the way there Jonathan! Way for the President's marshal&mdash;way for the government cannon! Way for the Federal foot and dragoons, (and the apparitions copiously tumbling.) I love to look on the Stars and Stripes, I hope the fifes will play Yankee Doodle. How bright shine the cutlasses of the foremost troops! Every man holds his revolver, marching stiff through Boston town. A fog follows, antiques of the same come limping, Some appear wooden-legged, and some appear bandaged and bloodless. Why this is indeed a show&mdash;it has called the dead out of the earth! The old graveyards of the hills have hurried to see! Phantoms! phantoms countless by flank and rear! Cock'd hats of mothy mould&mdash;crutches made of mist! Arms in slings&mdash;</p></div> </div>
