<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> When there are no more memories of heroes and martyrs, And when all life and all the souls of men and women are discharged from any part of the earth, Then only shall liberty or the idea of liberty be discharged from that part of the earth, And the infidel come into full possession. Then courage European revolter, revoltress! For till all ceases neither must you cease. I do not know what you are for, (I do not know what I am for myself, nor what any thing is for,) But I will search carefully for it even in being foil'd, In defeat, poverty, misconception, imprisonment&mdash;for they too are great. Did we think victory great? So it is&mdash;but now it seems to me, when it cannot be help'd, that defeat is great, And that death and dismay are great.</p></div> </div>
