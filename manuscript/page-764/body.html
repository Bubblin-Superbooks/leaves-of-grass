<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Delicate cluster! flag of teeming life! Covering all my lands&mdash;all my seashores lining! Flag of death! (how I watch'd you through the smoke of battle pressing! How I heard you flap and rustle, cloth defiant!) Flag cerulean&mdash;sunny flag, with the orbs of night dappled! Ah my silvery beauty&mdash;ah my woolly white and crimson! Ah to sing the song of you, my matron mighty! My sacred one, my mother.</p></div> </div>
