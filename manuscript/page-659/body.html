<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I'll pour the verse with streams of blood, full of volition, full of joy, Then loosen, launch forth, to go and compete, With the banner and pennant a-flapping. Pennant: Come up here, bard, bard, Come up here, soul, soul, Come up here, dear little child, To fly in the clouds and winds with me, and play with the measureless light. Child: Father what is that in the sky beckoning to me with long finger? And what does it say to me all the while? Father: Nothing my babe you see in the sky, And nothing at all to you it says&mdash;but look you my babe, Look at these dazzling things in the houses, and see you the money- shops opening, And see you the vehicles preparing to crawl along the streets with goods; These, ah these, how valued and toil'd for these! How envied by all the earth.</p></div> </div>
