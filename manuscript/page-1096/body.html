<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>hauling goods, the manly race of drivers of horses, the brown-faced sailors, The summer air, the bright sun shining, and the sailing clouds aloft, The winter snows, the sleigh-bells, the broken ice in the river, passing along up or down with the flood-tide or ebb-tide, The mechanics of the city, the masters, well-form'd, beautiful-faced, looking you straight in the eyes, Trottoirs throng'd, vehicles, Broadway, the women, the shops and shows, A million people&mdash;manners free and superb&mdash;open voices&mdash;hospitality&mdash; the most courageous and friendly young men, City of hurried and sparkling waters! city of spires and masts! City nested in bays! my city!</p></div> </div>
