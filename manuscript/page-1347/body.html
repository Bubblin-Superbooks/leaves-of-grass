<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>As I sit in twilight late alone by the flickering oak-flame, Musing on long-pass'd war-scenes&mdash;of the countless buried unknown soldiers, Of the vacant names, as unindented air's and sea's&mdash;the unreturn'd, The brief truce after battle, with grim burial-squads, and the deep-fill'd trenches Of gather'd from dead all America, North, South, East, West, whence they came up, From wooded Maine, New-England's farms, from fertile Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, From the measureless West, Virginia, the South, the Carolinas, Texas, (Even here in my room-shadows and half-lights in the noiseless flickering flames, Again I see the stalwart ranks on-filing, rising&mdash;I hear the rhythmic tramp of the armies;) You million unwrit names all, all&mdash;you dark bequest from all the war, A special verse for you&mdash;a flash of duty long neglected&mdash;</p></div> </div>
