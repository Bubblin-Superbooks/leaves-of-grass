<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Simple and fresh and fair from winter's close emerging, As if no artifice of fashion, business, politics, had ever been, Forth from its sunny nook of shelter'd grass&mdash;innocent, golden, calm as the dawn, The spring's first dandelion shows its trustful face.</p></div> </div>
