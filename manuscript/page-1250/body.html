<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Nothing is ever really lost, or can be lost, No birth, identity, form&mdash;no object of the world. Nor life, nor force, nor any visible thing; Appearance must not foil, nor shifted sphere confuse thy brain. Ample are time and space&mdash;ample the fields of Nature. The body, sluggish, aged, cold&mdash;the embers left from earlier fires, The light in the eye grown dim, shall duly flame again; The sun now low in the west rises for mornings and for noons continual; To frozen clods ever the spring's invisible law returns, With grass and flowers and summer fruits and corn.</p></div> </div>
