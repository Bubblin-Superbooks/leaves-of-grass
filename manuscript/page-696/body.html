<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>With its cloud of skirmishers in advance, With now the sound of a single shot snapping like a whip, and now an irregular volley, The swarming ranks press on and on, the dense brigades press on, Glittering dimly, toiling under the sun&mdash;the dust-cover'd men, In columns rise and fall to the undulations of the ground, With artillery interspers'd&mdash;the wheels rumble, the horses sweat, As the army corps advances.</p></div> </div>
