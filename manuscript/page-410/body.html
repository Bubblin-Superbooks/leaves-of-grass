<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A Song of Joys</p><p>O to make the most jubilant song! Full of music&mdash;full of manhood, womanhood, infancy! Full of common employments&mdash;full of grain and trees. O for the voices of animals&mdash;O for the swiftness and balance of fishes! O for the dropping of raindrops in a song! O for the sunshine and motion of waves in a song! O the joy of my spirit&mdash;it is uncaged&mdash;it darts like lightning! It is not enough to have this globe or a certain time, I will have thousands of globes and all time. O the engineer's joys! to go with a locomotive! To hear the hiss of steam, the merry shriek, the steam-whistle, the laughing locomotive! To push with resistless way and speed off in the distance.</p></div> </div>
