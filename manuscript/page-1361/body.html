<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The commonplace I sing; How cheap is health! how cheap nobility! Abstinence, no falsehood, no gluttony, lust; The open air I sing, freedom, toleration, (Take here the mainest lesson&mdash;less from books&mdash;less from the schools,) The common day and night&mdash;the common earth and waters, Your farm&mdash;your work, trade, occupation, The democratic wisdom underneath, like solid ground for all.</p></div> </div>
