<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Each man to himself and each woman to herself, is the word of the past and present, and the true word of immortality; No one can acquire for another&mdash;not one, Not one can grow for another&mdash;not one. The song is to the singer, and comes back most to him, The teaching is to the teacher, and comes back most to him, The murder is to the murderer, and comes back most to him, The theft is to the thief, and comes back most to him, The love is to the lover, and comes back most to him, The gift is to the giver, and comes back most to him&mdash;it cannot fail, The oration is to the orator, the acting is to the actor and actress not to the audience, And no man understands any greatness or goodness but his own, or the indication of his own. 3 I swear the earth shall surely be complete to him or her who shall be complete, The earth remains jagged and broken only to him or her who remains jagged and broken.</p></div> </div>
