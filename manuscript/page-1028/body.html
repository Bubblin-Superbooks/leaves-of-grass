<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Yet, yet, ye downcast hours, I know ye also, Weights of lead, how ye clog and cling at my ankles, Earth to a chamber of mourning turns&mdash;I hear the o'erweening, mocking voice, Matter is conqueror&mdash;matter, triumphant only, continues onward. Despairing cries float ceaselessly toward me, The call of my nearest lover, putting forth, alarm'd, uncertain, The sea I am quickly to sail, come tell me, Come tell me where I am speeding, tell me my destination. I understand your anguish, but I cannot help you, I approach, hear, behold, the sad mouth, the look out of the eyes, your mute inquiry, Whither I go from the bed I recline on, come tell me,&mdash; Old age, alarm'd, uncertain&mdash;a young woman's voice, appealing to me for comfort; A young man's voice, Shall I not escape?</p></div> </div>
