<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>8 Now trumpeter for thy close, Vouchsafe a higher strain than any yet, Sing to my soul, renew its languishing faith and hope, Rouse up my slow belief, give me some vision of the future, Give me for once its prophecy and joy. O glad, exulting, culminating song! A vigor more than earth's is in thy notes, Marches of victory&mdash;man disenthral'd&mdash;the conqueror at last, Hymns to the universal God from universal man&mdash;all joy! A reborn race appears&mdash;a perfect world, all joy! Women and men in wisdom innocence and health&mdash;all joy! Riotous laughing bacchanals fill'd with joy! War, sorrow, suffering gone&mdash;the rank earth purged&mdash;nothing but joy left! The ocean fill'd with joy&mdash;the atmosphere all joy! Joy! joy! in freedom, worship, love! joy in the ecstasy of life! Enough to merely be! enough to breathe! Joy! joy! all over joy!</p></div> </div>
