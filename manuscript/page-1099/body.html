<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Meditating among liars and retreating sternly into myself, I see that there are really no liars or lies after all, And that nothing fails its perfect return, and that what are called lies are perfect returns, And that each thing exactly represents itself and what has preceded it, And that the truth includes all, and is compact just as much as space is compact, And that there is no flaw or vacuum in the amount of the truth&mdash;but that all is truth without exception; And henceforth I will go celebrate any thing I see or am, And sing and laugh and deny nothing.</p></div> </div>
