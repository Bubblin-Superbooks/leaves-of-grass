<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Smile O voluptuous cool-breath'd earth! Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees! Earth of departed sunset&mdash;earth of the mountains misty-topt! Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just tinged with blue! Earth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the river! Earth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and clearer for my sake! Far-swooping elbow'd earth&mdash;rich apple-blossom'd earth! Smile, for your lover comes. Prodigal, you have given me love&mdash;therefore I to you give love! O unspeakable passionate love. Thruster holding me tight and that I hold tight! We hurt each other as the bridegroom and the bride hurt each other. 22 You sea! I resign myself to you also&mdash;</p></div> </div>
