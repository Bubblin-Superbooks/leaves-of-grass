<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Wast charged against my chants they had forgotten art? To fuse within themselves its rules precise and delicatesse? The lyrist's measur'd beat, the wrought-out temple's grace&mdash;column and polish'd arch forgot? But thou that revelest here&mdash;spirit that form'd this scene, They have remember'd thee.</p></div> </div>
