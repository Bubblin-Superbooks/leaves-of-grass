<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>After the supper and talk&mdash;after the day is done, As a friend from friends his final withdrawal prolonging, Good-bye and Good-bye with emotional lips repeating, (So hard for his hand to release those hands&mdash;no more will they meet, No more for communion of sorrow and joy, of old and young, A far-stretching journey awaits him, to return no more,) Shunning, postponing severance&mdash;seeking to ward off the last word ever so little, E'en at the exit-door turning&mdash;charges superfluous calling back&mdash; e'en as he descends the steps, Something to eke out a minute additional&mdash;shadows of nightfall deepening, Farewells, messages lessening&mdash;dimmer the forthgoer's visage and form, Soon to be lost for aye in the darkness&mdash;loth, O so loth to depart! Garrulous to the very last.</p></div> </div>
