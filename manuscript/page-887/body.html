<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> (The intentions perfect and divine, The workings, details, haply human.) 3 O thou within this tomb, From thee such scenes, thou stintless, lavish giver, Tallying the gifts of earth, large as the earth, Thy name an earth, with mountains, fields and tides. Nor by your streams alone, you rivers, By you, your banks Connecticut, By you and all your teeming life old Thames, By you Potomac laving the ground Washington trod, by you Patapsco, You Hudson, you endless Mississippi&mdash;nor you alone, But to the high seas launch, my thought, his memory.</p></div> </div>
