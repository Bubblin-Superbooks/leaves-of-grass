<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> And as to you Life I reckon you are the leavings of many deaths, (No doubt I have died myself ten thousand times before.) I hear you whispering there O stars of heaven, O suns&mdash;O grass of graves&mdash;O perpetual transfers and promotions, If you do not say any thing how can I say any thing? Of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest, Of the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing twilight, Toss, sparkles of day and dusk&mdash;toss on the black stems that decay in the muck, Toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs. I ascend from the moon, I ascend from the night, I perceive that the ghastly glimmer is noonday sunbeams reflected, And debouch to the steady and central from the offspring great or small. 50 There is that in me&mdash;I do not know what it is&mdash;but I know it is in me. Wrench'd and sweaty&mdash;calm and cool then my body becomes, I sleep&mdash;I sleep long.</p></div> </div>
