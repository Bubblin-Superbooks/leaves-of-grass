Haughty this song, its words and scope, To span vast realms of space and time, Evolution&mdash;the cumulative&mdash;growths and generations. Begun in ripen'd youth and steadily pursued, Wandering, peering, dallying with all&mdash;war, peace, day and night absorbing, Never even for one brief hour abandoning my task, I end it here in sickness, poverty, and old age. I sing of life, yet mind me well of death: To-day shadowy Death dogs my steps, my seated shape, and has for years&mdash; Draws sometimes close to me, as face to face.</p></div> </div>
