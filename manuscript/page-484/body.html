<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The hourly routine of your own or any man's life, the shop, yard, store, or factory, These shows all near you by day and night&mdash;workman! whoever you are, your daily life! In that and them the heft of the heaviest&mdash;in that and them far more than you estimated, (and far less also,) In them realities for you and me, in them poems for you and me, In them, not yourself-you and your soul enclose all things, regardless of estimation, In them the development good&mdash;in them all themes, hints, possibilities. I do not affirm that what you see beyond is futile, I do not advise you to stop, I do not say leadings you thought great are not great, But I say that none lead to greater than these lead to.</p></div> </div>
