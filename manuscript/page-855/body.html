<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>take one breath from my tremulous lips, Take one tear dropt aside as I go for thought of you, Dead house of love&mdash;house of madness and sin, crumbled, crush'd, House of life, erewhile talking and laughing&mdash;but ah, poor house, dead even then, Months, years, an echoing, garnish'd house&mdash;but dead, dead, dead.</p></div> </div>
