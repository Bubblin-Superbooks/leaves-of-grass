<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Upon this scene, this show, Yielded to-day by fashion, learning, wealth, (Nor in caprice alone&mdash;some grains of deepest meaning,) Haply, aloft, (who knows?) from distant sky-clouds' blended shapes, As some old tree, or rock or cliff, thrill'd with its soul, Product of Nature's sun, stars, earth direct&mdash;a towering human form, In hunting-shirt of film, arm'd with the rifle, a half-ironical smile curving its phantom lips, Like one of Ossian's ghosts looks down.</p></div> </div>
