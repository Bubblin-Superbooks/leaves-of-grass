<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> O to work in mines, or forging iron, Foundry casting, the foundry itself, the rude high roof, the ample and shadow'd space, The furnace, the hot liquid pour'd out and running. O to resume the joys of the soldier! To feel the presence of a brave commanding officer&mdash;to feel his sympathy! To behold his calmness&mdash;to be warm'd in the rays of his smile! To go to battle&mdash;to hear the bugles play and the drums beat! To hear the crash of artillery&mdash;to see the glittering of the bayonets and musket-barrels in the sun! To see men fall and die and not complain! To taste the savage taste of blood&mdash;to be so devilish! To gloat so over the wounds and deaths of the enemy.</p></div> </div>
