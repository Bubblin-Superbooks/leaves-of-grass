<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Then rattle quicker, heavier drums&mdash;you bugles wilder blow. Beat! beat! drums!&mdash;blow! bugles! blow! Make no parley&mdash;stop for no expostulation, Mind not the timid&mdash;mind not the weeper or prayer, Mind not the old man beseeching the young man, Let not the child's voice be heard, nor the mother's entreaties, Make even the trestles to shake the dead where they lie awaiting the hearses, So strong you thump O terrible drums&mdash;so loud you bugles blow.</p></div> </div>
