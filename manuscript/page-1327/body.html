<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Have I no weapon-word for thee&mdash;some message brief and fierce? (Have I fought out and done indeed the battle?) Is there no shot left, For all thy affectations, lisps, scorns, manifold silliness? Nor for myself&mdash;my own rebellious self in thee? Down, down, proud gorge!&mdash;though choking thee; Thy bearded throat and high-borne forehead to the gutter; Crouch low thy neck to eleemosynary gifts.</p></div> </div>
