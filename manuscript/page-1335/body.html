<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Over and through the burial chant, Organ and solemn service, sermon, bending priests, To me come interpolation sounds not in the show&mdash;plainly to me, crowding up the aisle and from the window, Of sudden battle's hurry and harsh noises&mdash;war's grim game to sight and ear in earnest; The scout call'd up and forward&mdash;the general mounted and his aides around him&mdash;the new-brought word&mdash;the instantaneous order issued; The rifle crack&mdash;the cannon thud&mdash;the rushing forth of men from their tents; The clank of cavalry&mdash;the strange celerity of forming ranks&mdash;the slender bugle note; The sound of horses' hoofs departing&mdash;saddles, arms, accoutrements.</p></div> </div>
