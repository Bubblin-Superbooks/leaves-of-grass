<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>What hurrying human tides, or day or night! What passions, winnings, losses, ardors, swim thy waters! What whirls of evil, bliss and sorrow, stem thee! What curious questioning glances&mdash;glints of love! Leer, envy, scorn, contempt, hope, aspiration! Thou portal&mdash;thou arena&mdash;thou of the myriad long-drawn lines and groups! (Could but thy flagstones, curbs, facades, tell their inimitable tales; Thy windows rich, and huge hotels&mdash;thy side-walks wide;) Thou of the endless sliding, mincing, shuffling feet! Thou, like the parti-colored world itself&mdash;like infinite, teeming, mocking life! Thou visor'd, vast, unspeakable show and lesson!</p></div> </div>
