<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>thy fearful music-song, wild player, brings every sight of fear, The deeds of ruthless brigands, rapine, murder&mdash;I hear the cries for help! I see ships foundering at sea, I behold on deck and below deck the terrible tableaus. 7 O trumpeter, methinks I am myself the instrument thou playest, Thou melt'st my heart, my brain&mdash;thou movest, drawest, changest them at will; And now thy sullen notes send darkness through me, Thou takest away all cheering light, all hope, I see the enslaved, the overthrown, the hurt, the opprest of the whole earth, I feel the measureless shame and humiliation of my race, it becomes all mine, Mine too the revenges of humanity, the wrongs of ages, baffled feuds and hatreds, Utter defeat upon me weighs&mdash;all lost&mdash;the foe victorious, (Yet 'mid the ruins Pride colossal stands unshaken to the last, Endurance, resolution to the last.)</p></div> </div>
