<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> 2 O maidens and young men I love and that love me, What you ask of my days those the strangest and sudden your talking recalls, Soldier alert I arrive after a long march cover'd with sweat and dust, In the nick of time I come, plunge in the fight, loudly shout in the rush of successful charge, Enter the captur'd works&mdash;yet lo, like a swift-running river they fade, Pass and are gone they fade&mdash;I dwell not on soldiers' perils or soldiers' joys, (Both I remember well&mdash;many the hardships, few the joys, yet I was content.) But in silence, in dreams' projections, While the world of gain and appearance and mirth goes on, So soon what is over forgotten, and waves wash the imprints off the sand, With hinged knees returning I enter the doors, (while for you up there, Whoever you are, follow without noise and be of strong heart.)</p></div> </div>
