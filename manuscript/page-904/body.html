<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I was looking a long while for Intentions, For a clew to the history of the past for myself, and for these chants&mdash;and now I have found it, It is not in those paged fables in the libraries, (them I neither accept nor reject,) It is no more in the legends than in all else, It is in the present&mdash;it is this earth to-day, It is in Democracy&mdash;(the purport and aim of all the past,) It is the life of one man or one woman to-day&mdash;the average man of to-day, It is in languages, social customs, literatures, arts, It is in the broad show of artificial things, ships, machinery, politics, creeds, modern improvements, and the interchange of nations, All for the modern&mdash;all for the average man of to-day.</p></div> </div>
