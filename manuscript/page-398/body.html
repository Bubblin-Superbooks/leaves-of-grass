<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Our Old Feuillage</p><p>Always our old feuillage! Always Florida's green peninsula&mdash;always the priceless delta of Louisiana&mdash;always the cotton-fields of Alabama and Texas, Always California's golden hills and hollows, and the silver mountains of New Mexico&mdash;always soft-breath'd Cuba, Always the vast slope drain'd by the Southern sea, inseparable with the slopes drain'd by the Eastern and Western seas, The area the eighty-third year of these States, the three and a half millions of square miles, The eighteen thousand miles of sea-coast and bay-coast on the main, the thirty thousand miles of river navigation, The seven millions of distinct families and the same number of dwellings&mdash; always these, and more, branching forth into numberless branches, Always the free range and diversity&mdash;always the continent of Democracy;</p></div> </div>
