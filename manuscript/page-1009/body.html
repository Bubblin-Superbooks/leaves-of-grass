<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Your farm, profits, crops&mdash;to think how engross'd you are, To think there will still be farms, profits, crops, yet for you of what avail? 6 What will be will be well, for what is is well, To take interest is well, and not to take interest shall be well. The domestic joys, the dally housework or business, the building of houses, are not phantasms, they have weight, form, location, Farms, profits, crops, markets, wages, government, are none of them phantasms, The difference between sin and goodness is no delusion, The earth is not an echo, man and his life and all the things of his life are well-consider'd. You are not thrown to the winds, you gather certainly and safely around yourself, Yourself! yourself!. yourself, for ever and ever!</p></div> </div>
