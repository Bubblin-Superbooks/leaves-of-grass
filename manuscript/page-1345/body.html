<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Sounds of the winter too, Sunshine upon the mountains&mdash;many a distant strain From cheery railroad train&mdash;from nearer field, barn, house, The whispering air&mdash;even the mute crops, garner'd apples, corn, Children's and women's tones&mdash;rhythm of many a farmer and of flail, An old man's garrulous lips among the rest, Think not we give out yet, Forth from these snowy hairs we keep up yet the lilt.</p></div> </div>
