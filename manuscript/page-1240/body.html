<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Of that blithe throat of thine from arctic bleak and blank, I'll mind the lesson, solitary bird&mdash;let me too welcome chilling drifts, E'en the profoundest chill, as now&mdash;a torpid pulse, a brain unnerv'd, Old age land-lock'd within its winter bay&mdash;(cold, cold, O cold!) These snowy hairs, my feeble arm, my frozen feet, For them thy faith, thy rule I take, and grave it to the last; Not summer's zones alone&mdash;not chants of youth, or south's warm tides alone, But held by sluggish floes, pack'd in the northern ice, the cumulus of years, These with gay heart I also sing.</p></div> </div>
