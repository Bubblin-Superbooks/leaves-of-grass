<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> My mother look'd in delight and amazement at the stranger, She look'd at the freshness of her tall-borne face and full and pliant limbs, The more she look'd upon her she loved her, Never before had she seen such wonderful beauty and purity, She made her sit on a bench by the jamb of the fireplace, she cook'd food for her, She had no work to give her, but she gave her remembrance and fondness. The red squaw staid all the forenoon, and toward the middle of the afternoon she went away, O my mother was loth to have her go away, All the week she thought of her, she watch'd for her many a month, She remember'd her many a winter and many a summer, But the red squaw never came nor was heard of there again. 7 A show of the summer softness&mdash;a contact of something unseen&mdash;an amour of the light and air, I am jealous and overwhelm'd with friendliness, And will go gallivant with the light and air myself.</p></div> </div>
