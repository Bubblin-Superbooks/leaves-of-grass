<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Beat! beat! drums!&mdash;blow! bugles! blow! Through the windows&mdash;through doors&mdash;burst like a ruthless force, Into the solemn church, and scatter the congregation, Into the school where the scholar is studying; Leave not the bridegroom quiet&mdash;no happiness must he have now with his bride, Nor the peaceful farmer any peace, ploughing his field or gathering his grain, So fierce you whirr and pound you drums&mdash;so shrill you bugles blow. Beat! beat! drums!&mdash;blow! bugles! blow! Over the traffic of cities&mdash;over the rumble of wheels in the streets; Are beds prepared for sleepers at night in the houses? no sleepers must sleep in those beds, No bargainers' bargains by day&mdash;no brokers or speculators&mdash;would they continue? Would the talkers be talking? would the singer attempt to sing? Would the lawyer rise in the court to state his case before the judge?</p></div> </div>
