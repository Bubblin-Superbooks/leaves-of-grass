Beat! Drums! or To the Leaven'd Soil they Trod, Or Captain! My Captain! Kosmos, Quicksand Years, or Thoughts, Thou Mother with thy Equal Brood," and many, many more unspecified, From fibre heart of mine&mdash;from throat and tongue&mdash;(My life's hot pulsing blood, The personal urge and form for me&mdash;not merely paper, automatic type and ink,) Each song of mine&mdash;each utterance in the past&mdash;having its long, long history, Of life or death, or soldier's wound, of country's loss or safety, (O heaven! what flash and started endless train of all! compared indeed to that! What wretched shred e'en at the best of all!)</p></div> </div>
