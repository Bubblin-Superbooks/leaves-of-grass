<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A breed whose proof is in time and deeds, What we are we are, nativity is answer enough to objections, We wield ourselves as a weapon is wielded, We are powerful and tremendous in ourselves, We are executive in ourselves, we are sufficient in the variety of ourselves, We are the most beautiful to ourselves and in ourselves, We stand self-pois'd in the middle, branching thence over the world, From Missouri, Nebraska, or Kansas, laughing attacks to scorn. Nothing is sinful to us outside of ourselves, Whatever appears, whatever does not appear, we are beautiful or sinful in ourselves only. (O Mother&mdash;O Sisters dear! If we are lost, no victor else has destroy'd us, It is by ourselves we go down to eternal night.) 3 Have you thought there could be but a single supreme? There can be any number of supremes&mdash;</p></div> </div>
