But drill and parade are over, they march back to quarters, Only hear that approval of hands! hear what a clapping! As wending the crowds now part and disperse&mdash;but we old man, Not for nothing have I brought you hither&mdash;we must remain, You to speak in your turn, and I to listen and tell. [The Centenarian] When I clutch'd your hand it was not with terror, But suddenly pouring about me here on every side, And below there where the boys were drilling, and up the slopes they ran, And where tents are pitch'd, and wherever you see south and south- east</p></div> </div>
