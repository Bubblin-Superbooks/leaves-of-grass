<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>You lingering sparse leaves of me on winter-nearing boughs, And I some well-shorn tree of field or orchard-row; You tokens diminute and lorn&mdash;(not now the flush of May, or July clover-bloom&mdash;no grain of August now;) You pallid banner-staves&mdash;you pennants valueless&mdash;you overstay'd of time, Yet my soul-dearest leaves confirming all the rest, The faithfulest&mdash;hardiest&mdash;last.</p></div> </div>
