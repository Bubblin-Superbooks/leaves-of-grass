<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Greater than memory of Achilles or Ulysses, More, more by far to thee than tomb of Alexander, Those cart loads of old charnel ashes, scales and splints of mouldy bones, Once living men&mdash;once resolute courage, aspiration, strength, The stepping stones to thee to-day and here, America.</p></div> </div>
