<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>O you banner leading the day with stars brought from the night! Valueless, object of eyes, over all and demanding all&mdash;(absolute owner of all)&mdash;O banner and pennant! I too leave the rest&mdash;great as it is, it is nothing&mdash;houses, machines are nothing&mdash;I see them not, I see but you, O warlike pennant! O banner so broad, with stripes, sing you only, Flapping up there in the wind.</p></div> </div>
