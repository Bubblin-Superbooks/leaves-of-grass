<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> the summer is here! and what is this in it and from it? Thou, soul, unloosen'd&mdash;the restlessness after I know not what; Come, let us lag here no longer, let us be up and away! O if one could but fly like a bird! O to escape, to sail forth as in a ship! To glide with thee O soul, o'er all, in all, as a ship o'er the waters; Gathering these hints, the preludes, the blue sky, the grass, the morning drops of dew, The lilac-scent, the bushes with dark green heart-shaped leaves, Wood-violets, the little delicate pale blossoms called innocence, Samples and sorts not for themselves alone, but for their atmosphere, To grace the bush I love&mdash;to sing with the birds, A warble for joy of returning in reminiscence.</p></div> </div>
