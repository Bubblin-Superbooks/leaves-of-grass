<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I am the poet of the woman the same as the man, And I say it is as great to be a woman as to be a man, And I say there is nothing greater than the mother of men. I chant the chant of dilation or pride, We have had ducking and deprecating about enough, I show that size is only development. Have you outstript the rest? are you the President? It is a trifle, they will more than arrive there every one, and still pass on. I am he that walks with the tender and growing night, I call to the earth and sea half-held by the night. Press close bare-bosom'd night&mdash;press close magnetic nourishing night! Night of south winds&mdash;night of the large few stars! Still nodding night&mdash;mad naked summer night.</p></div> </div>
