Ever-returning spring, trinity sure to me you bring, Lilac blooming perennial and drooping star in the west, And thought of him I love. 2 O powerful western fallen star! O shades of night&mdash;O moody, tearful night! O great star disappear'd&mdash;O the black murk that hides the star! O cruel hands that hold me powerless&mdash;O helpless soul of me! O harsh surrounding cloud that will not free my soul.</p></div> </div>
