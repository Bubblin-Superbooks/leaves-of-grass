<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The touch of flame&mdash;the illuminating fire&mdash;the loftiest look at last, O'er city, passion, sea&mdash;o'er prairie, mountain, wood&mdash;the earth itself, The airy, different, changing hues of all, in failing twilight, Objects and groups, bearings, faces, reminiscences; The calmer sight&mdash;the golden setting, clear and broad: So much i' the atmosphere, the points of view, the situations whence we scan, Bro't out by them alone&mdash;so much (perhaps the best) unreck'd before; The lights indeed from them&mdash;old age's lambent peaks.</p></div> </div>
